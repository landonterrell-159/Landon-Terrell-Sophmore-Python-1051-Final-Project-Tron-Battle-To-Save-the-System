Overall, I really enjoyed this project. It taught me a lot, and I spent a significant amount of time working on it. One of the biggest challenges I faced was learning how to actually code in a new language while also navigating Creator Studio. I had never used any type of game-development platform before, let alone one with a completely different scripting language. The hardest part was coding the light trails that kill. I didn’t understand how to integrate the killing function into my game. At first, I tried coding the kill effect directly into the bike’s light trail, but that didn’t work because the visual trail isn’t a physical object. I wasn’t even sure if what I wanted was possible, so I started researching until I eventually found a Reddit post from seven years ago explaining that its possible to spawn physical blocks behind the player. That was the breakthrough I needed. Once I understood the concept, I began coding again and finally figured out how to make it work. Overall, I had a lot of fun with this project, and if you would like to play it, the finished version is published on Roblox.
